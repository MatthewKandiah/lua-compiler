# lua-compiler
Learning exercise - how would you build a Lua compiler? 

Goal - take a lua source file as input, generate executable machine code. Simple!

Note - cmake makes my head hurt, so I've blindly followed the advice in https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/chapters/basics/structure.html to set up my project. I've got an executable building and tests running, which I think is probably good enough for my purposes. If I hit any pain points, it's probably worth revisiting and actually thinking about it a little more!
